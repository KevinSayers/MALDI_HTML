# MALDI_HTML
The goal of MALDI HTML is to easily create portable HTML files from MALDI-TOF MS spectra files.

1. Generates an HTML site from selected spectra files using Plotly.JS
2. The spectra can be viewed interactively with zoom and pan
3. The resulting HTML file can be emailed to collaborators who may not have a spectra viewer.
